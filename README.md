# File Manager
*This proyect is **not yet finished** and for now it has no usage.*

This program is being developed to handle most of the used files in java among some file formats to allow manipulating files easier.

The whole purpose of this project is to bring java IO closer to the user with a more sensitive and operative environment, allowing the creation of a file with just a line of code.

This is a rework of an old project of mine. It had almost every simple file type covered, not file types but file formats, among image and audio files, however this project is focused as a expansion with a better base, allowing the user to also create custom file formatters.

Current plans are to add everything that the old file manager had trying to maintain a better structure and faster processing

The whole purpose of this project is to make IO easier, meaning that as long-term goal I would like to remove as many errors as I can and also allow the user to use complex files as yaml, xml and more file formats for audio, image, fonts and even video files.
